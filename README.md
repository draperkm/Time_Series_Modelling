# Time_Series_Modelling

Time series models are used to forecast events based on verified historical data. Common types include ARIMA, smooth-based, and moving average. We used data from.

Using the function `get.hist.quote` in the `tseries library`, I extracted a subset with the size of around 4000 samples, from daily adjusted prices on the `FTSE250 index` (instrument^FTMC) ranging from 1st January 2000 to 15th February 2021. In the report, I have discussed about the modelling of the logreturns calculated from these data.
